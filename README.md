# OSS Idle

**This is a work in project, and not fully published yet**

Open Source Software Idle (OSS Idle) is a project with two goals behind it.

Firstly, the creator (@Clorith) is a big fan of idle/incremental/clicker style games, and being involved with open source communities, wanted to build something based on an area where he had some familiarity.

Secondly, it serves to show various aspects of open source maintenance, as your project grows, so does the elements involved in its continued development.

This is all fun and games, so enjoy, maybe pick up a thing or two, and see where it all goes!

## Acknowledgements

The interface is inspired by, and made as similar as possible to, the WordPress admin interface. Being a large open source project, this just felt like the right fit, it's an interface which may be familiar to many users, even non-technical ones.

As such, you may find some references to familiar class names, or markup, that may have been inherited from other projects.

In the spirit of open source, the idle game is of course available in its entirety, feel free to browse the code, fork it, play with it, do something fun! Of course, some of the mystery may be lost in doing so, as you won't discover things through the game itself, you have been warned.

Reusable components, UI elements, and icons, are from the [Material UI](https://mui.com/) component library.
